# Random

Random miscellaneous things, mostly single use 'disposable' proof-of-concepts, and other scripts or projects that are interesting enough to be shared, but small enough to not warrant a separate repository.

Do not use any of these for anything important, they may not be maintained and are likely to be insecure, broken or buggy.

yes the code is very messy
